                    <p>Growing up, I never had a problem with boredom. I could entertain myself wherever I was, If I wanted to watch a movie, but couldn’t go to the store, I would make story boards. If I was given a doll or a stuffed animal, I always modified it. I never waited for people to give me exactly what I wanted, I had the drive and creativity to create it myself. Problem solving is what I do, story telling is how I communicate.</p>

                    <p>The love of story telling led to a career in Theatre, first specializing in Stage Management then Prop Design. My years in the theatre industry gave me invaluable experience and problem solving abilities.</p>

                    <p>At the age of 20 I began to travel. Through the next 8 years I would travel over 15 different countries, taking in as much culture and diving as possible. Much of my personal works relates to water and the life changing experiences I have gained through scuba diving around the world.</p>

                    <p> Graphic Design has been a eye opening experience for me. Driven by the need to explore a new creative medium I have never been tested so much as I have been in my years at college studying design. But it was through my experience there that I was introduced to Motion graphics. The ultimate tool for story telling. It is from that point on that I would take to learning everything I could about Motion graphics and the potential it represents for the future.</p>
