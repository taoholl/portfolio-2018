Growing up, I never had a problem with boredom. I could entertain myself wherever I was, If I wanted to watch a movie, but couldnâ€™t go to the store, I would make story boards. If I was given a doll or a stuffed animal, I always modified it. I never waited for people to give me exactly what I wanted, I had the drive and creativity to create it myself. Problem solving is what I do, story telling is how I communicate.
