      <div class="milli max-length special">
        <p class="text-center">The objective was to create an annual report  that relays important information while visually engaging the reader. This was my second annual report, created in my second year of graphic design at Algonquin College. The Annual Report was done in both English and French.</p>

        <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">DEFINITION STATEMENT |</h2>

        <p class="text-center">This project was done with Adobe Photoshop and Adobe InDesign </p>

        <div class="embed embed-golden">

        <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">THEME |</h2>

        <p class="text-center">The design was to showcase the children and their future thanks to Cheo and the work they do. Throughout the book are photos of children with a future promise drawn on their photos. This allows the reader to relate personally with the book without focusing on the childrenâ€™s illness.</p>
