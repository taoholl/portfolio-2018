    <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">PROJECT OBJECTIVE</h2>
      <div class="milli max-length special">
        <p>The project objective was to create a motion piece using handmade, tactile assets. The project was open concept.</p>

        <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">SKETCHES</h2>

        <p>My idea started off very elaborate, telling the story of a man and a stray, and how recently the mans heart was broken and he thought everything was lost. The man is seen in a park and buries himself in a self help book. A lonely dog notices that the man is upset and tried everything to make it better by bringing him his most beloved things found in the park. It is only at the end the story when a ball hits the mans foot that he becomes aware of the world around him, and sees that there is kindness everywhere, and this dog, who did not know him, loves him.</p>
        <p> The project would be done in stop motion using clay and a handbuilt set.</p>

        <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">PROBLEMS</h2>

        <p>In reality I did not have the experience or the time to do this project. This was one of the first motion projects we did and was my first attempt at stop motion. The clay I bought was cheap, and although it said that it was not quick dry, it dried almost immediately which meant I had to cut the story short and move quickly. I immediately changed my aesthetic to a grungy world.</p>

        <h2 class="milli push bold special wrapper pad-t-2">THE EVOLUTION</h2>

        <p> Because of my time restrictions and the clay cracked easily, I created a world where everything was grungy. The man didn’t become a man at all but a manifest of human despair, his outfit was made of rough paper and stuck together with messy hot glue.  This created the disappearing world around the character, a limbo if you will. The dog remained a symbol for kindness and how a simple act could change a person forever.</p>
